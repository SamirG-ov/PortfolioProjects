# Airbnb Data Analysis: Seattle

This project involves analyzing Airbnb data from Seattle using Excel for exploration and Tableau for visualization. Our goal is to identify key trends and present them in a clear, understandable manner for stakeholders.

## Project Description

### Exploration with Excel
We start by exploring the dataset using Excel to uncover trends and insights. This preliminary analysis helps us identify key areas to focus on for our visualizations.
