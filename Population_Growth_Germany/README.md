# Population Analysis Project

## Overview
This project utilizes R and the tidyverse package for analyzing and visualizing world population data. The main focus is on exploring population trends across different countries, with specific attention to European nations.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have R installed on your machine. Additionally, install the tidyverse package using the following commands in your R console:

```r
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```
## Data

The project uses population data sourced from "world_population.csv". The dataset includes population figures for various years across different countries and territories.

## Analysis Steps

1.   Data Loading and Cleaning: The initial step involves loading the dataset and renaming columns for easier manipulation.

2.   European Countries Analysis: Subset the dataset to focus on European countries with populations of at least 1,000,000.

3.   Population Trends: Analyze and visualize population trends, with a specific case study on Germany. This includes plotting population growth from 2015 to 2022 using ggplot2.
